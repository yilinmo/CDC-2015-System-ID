\section{KPA in CPS}\label{sec:sysid}
In this section, we shall first apply closed-loop system identification technique to the CPS and investigate the identifiability condition of $\mG(z)$ and $\mK(z)$ in Section~\ref{sec:idGK} (an algorithm to perform the identification has been proposed in \cite{Yuan2015}). A stealthy attack which is enabled by KPA is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:stealthy}.
