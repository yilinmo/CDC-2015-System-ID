  \section{Conclusion}
  \label{sec:conclusion}
We consider KPA in CPS and provide a necessary condition and a sufficient condition under which the transfer function of the physical system can be uniquely identified by an adversary who passively observes the control input and sensory data. Our results demonstrate the vulnerability of the classical MIMO feedback control systems to KPA. A low-rank controller design framework is then proposed to prevent the adversary from identifying the exact physical system model. The design trade-off between system performance and security has been investigated.
