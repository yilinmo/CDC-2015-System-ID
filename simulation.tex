\section{Numerical Example}
\label{sec:simulation}
In this section, we provide a numerical example to illustrate our low-rank controller design. We assume that $n = 15,\,m = p =10$. The $Q,\,R,\,W,\,U$ matrices are all chosen to be identity matrix. The matrix $A,\,B,\,C$ are randomly generated, where each entry is independently drawn from a uniform distribution on $[0,1]$.

We consider the LQG performance of a low-rank controller versus the performance of an optimal controller with no rank constraint. We define the relative performance loss as
\begin{align*}
  \frac{J\text{ of the low rank controller}}{J\text{ of the optimal controller}} - 1.
\end{align*}

We will choose $q$ from $5$ to $9$ and for each $q$, we will perform $1000$ random experiments. Fig~\ref{fig:lqgloss} is the box and whisker diagram of the relative LQG performance loss generated by the random experiments.
One can see that even if $q = 5$, meaning that we only use half degrees of freedom to design the controller, the LQG loss is still small, with median loss at $6\%$.
